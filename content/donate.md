## We need your support!
LibreHealth is a 100% volunteer-run organization, with all of our contributors (developers, support, and leadership) donating their time and talents. While we would love to have you join our effort, we realize not everyone is able to contribute in this way. That's why we make it easy for you to support us with a financial gift.

## We're part of Software Freedom Conservancy

Software Freedom Conservancy, Inc. is a United States 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization incorporated in New York. Software Freedom Conservancy helps promote, improve, develop, and defend Free, Libre, and Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects. Conservancy provides a non-profit home and infrastructure for FLOSS projects. This allows FLOSS developers to focus on what they do best — writing and improving FLOSS for the general public — while Conservancy takes care of the projects' needs that do not relate directly to software development and documentation.

As a not-for-profit charity, LibreHealth and the rest of Conservancy relies on support from the public to continue its work. Software Freedom Conservancy, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) organization incorporated in New York, and donations made to it are fully tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.
