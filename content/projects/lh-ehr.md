The LibreHealth EHR application is a clinically-focused electronic health record (EHR) system designed to be both easy to use "out of the box" and also customizable for use in a variety of health care settings. It builds on the strength of the LibreHealth Toolkit, and adapts many of the proven user experiences built over many years with [OpenEMR](https://www.oemr.org). It is designed to be a modern, easy-to-use experience for health care professionals in their daily work.
