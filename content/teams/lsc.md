The LibreHealth Steering Committee consists of members who are committed to
steering LibreHealth to advance its market and technical success, and who serve
as positive ambassadors for the project. The LibreHealth Steering Committee
manages non-technical aspects of LibreHealth including funding for shared
project infrastructure, marketing and events, and managing LibreHealth
trademarks. The Steering Committee leaves all technical decisions to the open
source meritocracy.
