**About Us:** The Steering Committee for LibreHealth EHR had the vision of offering a separate open source electronic health record (EHR) devoted to education. The vision was further promoted and supported by the Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis (IUPUI) and the University of West Florida (UWF). These individuals and universities were very aware of the shortage of EHR models that could be used by a variety of clinical, health informatics, health information management and health science students and faculty. It is their hope that offering an affordable open-source EHR for education will further EHR training, health education and research.

**Mission:** to utilize an existing open-source electronic health record (LibreHealth EHR) that will include de-identified patient-level data.

**Vision:** create a state-of-the-art educational ambulatory electronic health record (EHR) that is customizable and affordable, with high usability and accessibility for a variety of health informatics, health information management and health science students

**Strategies:** populate the open-source LibreHealth EHR with patient data from the 2011-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data set.

**Goals:** After implementation, the goals are as follows:

 * Provide a realistic web-based EHR for informatics, HIM and health sciences students and instructors
 * Host the EHR on a platform that is affordable for multiple users
 * Develop real-world scenarios and case studies for the educational EHR
 * Develop a research platform so NHANES data within the EHR can be mined

**Objectives:**

 * Populate the EHR with selected patient data from NHANES 2011-2012 collection period by July 1, 2017
 * Identify a web hosting service that allows multiple EHR instances and is affordable
 * Create 5 teaching scenarios by August 1, 2017
 * Identify the most secure method to give access to database data in LibreHealth for multiple instructors

**Action plans:**

 * Technical:

   * Complete the uploading process of NHANES data
   * Identify the best web hosting platform for multiple universities to participate
   * Identify the best and most secure mechanism for data downloads for analysis, such as SQL data dumps
   * Create a new web page on LibreHealth.io for this educational initiative
   * Make LibreHealth EHR software available for installation on GitHub with installation instructions
   <br/> <br/>

 * Educational:

   * Evaluate the membership and activities of the Education Team
   * Discuss whether commercial partners exist for the educational EHR
   * Develop teaching scenarios and case studies for hands on exercises.
   * Create realistic patient encounter notes and imaging for a core of test patients (for example 20 patients with common diagnoses).
   * Discuss at 2017 AMIA InSpire Conference
   * Identify test universities for the LibreHealth educational EHR for the fall semester
   * IUPUI to work on grant funding for expansion and enhancement of LibreHealth EHR for education
