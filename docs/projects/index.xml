      <description>Our Toolkit software serves as the foundational API and data model for many other Health IT applications. It will be frequently (but not always) utilized as an upstream product for building other LibreHealth software. Toolkit is a fork of the OpenMRS Platform, and builds on its reliability while improving performance and ease of installation and use.
