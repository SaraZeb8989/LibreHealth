      <description>The LibreHealth Infrastructure Team is responsible for maintaining the infrastructure which LibreHealth relies on. Part of this requires that we have consistent monitoring/alerting if systems are misbehaving or become unavailable.
Services provided to us free as an Open Source organization Datadog We are very gracious to Datadog for providing use of their service free of charge through their open source program.
About Datadog Datadog is a cloud-based service which provides infrastructure monitoring.</description>
