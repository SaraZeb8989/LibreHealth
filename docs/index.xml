It will be frequently (but not always) utilized as an upstream product for building other LibreHealth software. Toolkit is a fork of the OpenMRS Platform, and builds on its reliability while improving performance and ease of installation and use.
Features  Community-driven EHR toolkit: Built by and for the community. Your contributions help shape the product.</description>
